Please run the "run_all" program to pull and calculate the summary tables and to format the appropriate cells.

I broke down the problem into sub programs, "summary_table", "conditionals_formatting", "summary_table_2" and created a master program, "run_all" to call and run these programs. The "clear_sheet" program clears any previous data and formatting where the tables will sit. And lastly, "clear_all" is the same as "clear_sheets" but for all worksheets.
